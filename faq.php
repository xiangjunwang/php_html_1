		          <h1>FAQ</h1>
		          <h3>Who is the team behind <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span>? </h3>
		          <p>We&rsquo;re a team of environmentalists, digital media activists, marketers, developers and graphic designers. One year ago, we came together to solve a problem in environmental advocacy. We see a missing tool in connecting people with active environmental groups in their neighborhoods, cities and even nations. For us, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> is one solution to the problem by using mobile technology to serve users as an entry-point into the world of environmental advocacy. To learn more about our team, visits: <a href='aboutus.php'>About us</a></p>
		    	  <h3>How can a mobile app affect tangible social change?</h3>
		          <p>Mobile has become a daily part of our reality, allowing us to connect anywhere and everywhere.  By 2014 it&rsquo;s predicted that <a href='#'>7.3 billion mobile phones</a> will be in use globally, while there is over <a href='#'>700,000 active apps</a> on Apple and Google. Mobile apps are a powerful technology, especially if used as a tool for social change. </p>          
		          <p>But for mobile technology to be effective it must transfer digital action into real-world action. <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> holds this key. This mobile app connects users with active and environmental groups that are close to them, encouraging a transference into real-world advocacy. Plus, the app keeps the user up-to-date with tangible campaigns and actions to get involved in. Doing more than talking in the digital sphere, this app walks the walk. </p>
		          <h3>What makes <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> different than other cause-based apps?</h3>
		          <p>The app serves as an entry point in the world of environmental advocacy by connecting two important communities together. The first community is you, the public, who is concerned with the state of our planet but lacks the tools to anything about it. The second community are the environmental groups that have numerous campaigns to address some of these issues but lack the larger participation to be successful. Connecting these two groups together, <span class='blod'>ACTIVTE</span> will put the power of change-making into the hands of the user. </p>
		          <h3>What geographic regions will this app cover? </h3>
		          <p>The first version of this app will focus on the United States and Canada, including environmental groups and campaigns in these nations. However, the intent of the later versions of the app will expand with a global reach.</p>
		          <h3>When will <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> be launched? </h3>
		          <p>The beta version of <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> will be launched in late summer 2014. This first version will include at least 3-5 groups in every environmental category the app offers: climate change, ocean conservation, animal rights, forests, water scarcity, food justice, Toxins/ Pollutions. Following, our second version will include more groups and crowdsourcing technology that will allow for user-generated content to input their own groups, campaigns and actions. </p>
		          <h3>Who is the target audience for this app?</h3>
		          <p>While <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> is open to all audiences, our target audienceis the <a href='#'>Millennial</a> demographic or otherwise known as Generation Y (born between 1979 and 1995). This modern-day &ldquo;youth culture&rdquo; is the largest to have ever existed, there are <a href="#">3.5 billion people</a> under the age of thirty. The <a href="#">UN calls</a> them &ldquo;the new global power reshaping the world.&rdquo; Being civically engaged, global youth contribute <a href="#">2.4 billion hours</a> to voluntary causes each year. That&rsquo;s a powerful force for social change. The <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> App intends to encourage this trend by providing more young people with the tools they need to be civically engaged when it comes to environmental issues. </p>
		          <h3>Doesn&rsquo;t this just encourage more &ldquo;Slacktivism&rdquo;?</h3>
		          <p>The idea behind <a href="#">&ldquo;Slacktivism,&rdquo;</a> is highly debated when it comes to digital advocacy. Many argue that digital forms of activism encourage a laze-fair practice of civic engagement, with encouraging clicking rather than voting or attending rallies. Others argue that digital advocacy only leads to a placebo affect, a &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; measure whereby the user believes that they made an impact without any quantifiable change occurring. </p>
		          <p>Taking these concerns seriously, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> offers more than just &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; in the digital sphere, but an entry point into the world of environmental advocacy. By connecting users with active environmental groups and tangible campaigns, this app encourages its users to transfer their online activities into real-world activities. In this, the apps&rsquo;s goal is to heighten citizen engagement in our global environmental crises.</p>
		          <h3>What about the problem of e-gadget waste? Does encouraging app use support further waste? </h3>
		          <p>It is true, mobile phone are a big part of the problem when it comes to e-gadget waste. In the United States, an estimated <a href="#">70% of heavy metals</a> in landfills comes from discarded electronics including mobile phones. Meanwhile when it comes to climate change, the reality is manufacturing of an ordinary mobile phone is estimated to cause <a href="#">16kg of CO2</a> equivalent emissions, nearly the same as 1 kg of beef. Add the power it consumes over two years and transmitting across networks, it&rsquo;s estimated that a phone can amount to <a href="#">94 kg CO2</a> equivalent over its lifetime. </p>
		          <p>Responding to this issue, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> has a mandate to not just talk about the problems, but make people aware of the solutions. That is why <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> will support the use of &ldquo;ethical phones&rdquo; and phones with a high repair score on <a href='#'>iFixIt.com</a>. Ethical phones are a new emerging bread of smartphone, including <a href="#">Phonebloks</a>, whereby you replace only the parts you need than the whole phone, and <a href="#">Fairphone</a> that are phones made 100% from &ldquo;conflict-free&rdquo; minerals. In supporting these phones, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> will include free promotion of these companies in ads on the app and through the feeds to the users. </p>
		          <h3>What issues does this app include? </h3>
		          <p>In it&rsquo;s first version, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> will include seven core environmental issues. This includes: climate change, ocean conservation, animal rights, forests, water scarcity, food justice, Toxins/ Pollutions. In later versions of the app we will include more environmental issues. If you would like to include your group in one of these categories, please contact <a href='#'>contact@ActiveApp.org</a></p>
		          <h3>Why not include social justice or economic justice issues? </h3>
		          <p>Every app has its niche and <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span>&rsquo;s niche is in environmental advocacy. There are growing online presences for social justice and economic justice movements. But by <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> focusing on one movement, the app offers specialized information and networking to its users in the area of environmentalism. </p>
		          <h3>I want to volunteer, how can I get involved? </h3>
		          <p>We are currently looking for volunteers across US and Canada in every state and province. This is an important role, as volunteers would become ambassadors for their region.  Ambassadors would research active environmental groups and campaign in their region. From there, we would ask our ambassadors to keep our system up-to-date by alerting us of any upcoming actions or new campaigns happening in their region. If you&rsquo;re interested in becoming an <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> Ambassador, email: <a href='#'>contact@ActiveApp.org</a></p>
		          <h3>Will this app be open-sourced? </h3>
		          <p>The short answer is YES! After the launch of the first version by our team, we want to open the app up for developers to help us take <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> to the next level. If you see bugs in the system or have a better idea for the app to be engaging, become apart of our team (see below).  Also, in a later version, we intend to make the app crowdsourcing from the community, whereby user-generated content can input data anytime on upcoming actions, campaigns or groups.  </p>
		          <h3>I am a developer, how can I get involved? </h3>
		          <p>We&rsquo;re always looking to expand our team with digitally skilled people, specially developers as we launch later versions of the app. Unfortunately, we cannot offer monetary compensation at this time to either developers or social media managers. We are happy to offer advertising space and credit to your company or person in exchange. If you are interested in joining our team, email: <a href='#'>contact@ActiveApp.org</a></p>
		          <h3>We&rsquo;re an environmental group, how can we get involved? </h3>
		          <p>We&rsquo;re presently looking for allies and partners to join <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> in the first phase of development.  Launching summer 2014, we want to offer this app to your organization at no cost. Think about it is an app to mobilize your community for upcoming campaigns, rallies or build your up your chapters. Plus, your organization will receive heighten exposure in the mobile world with new participants joining your cause who are users of our app. This happens thorough giving your organization a dedicated page on the app to promote your causes and campaign, while it gets plugged into our geo-mapping system.  Contact us for more information: <a href='#'>contact@ActiveApp.org</a></p>
		          <h3>Will there be advertising on the app? </h3>
		          <p>In the financial sustainability of the app, there will be advertising space for companies and non-profits. However, <span class='bold'>ACTIVATE</span> will only offer advertising space for companies and non-profits with strong sustainability policies, such as B Corporations, those involved in the One Percent for the Planet program, and those that uphold a &ldquo;triple-bottom line&rdquo; model  (Profit, People & Planet).  For advertising opportunities, please contact: <a href='#'>contact@ActiveApp.org</a></p>
